======================================
Ion Auth 2

The future of authentication

by Ben Edmunds
======================================

Redux Auth 2 had a lot of potential.  It's lightweight, simple, and clean, 
but had a ton of bugs and was missing some key features.  So we refactored 
the code and added new features.

This version drops any backwards compatibility and makes things even more 
awesome then you could expect.

DOCUMENTATION:
Documentation WILL BE located at http://benedmunds.com/ion_auth/

INSTALLATION:
Just copy the files from this package to the correspoding folder in your 
application folder.  For example, copy Ion_auth/config/ion_auth.php to 
system/application/config/ion_auth.php.  
Then just run the appropriate SQL file (if you're using migrations you can 
get the migrations from JD here: 
https://github.com/iamfiscus/codeigniter-ion-auth-migration).

USING THE LIBRARY:   
In the package you will find example usage code in the controllers and views 
folders.  The example code isn't the most beautiful code you'll ever see but 
it'll show you how to use the library and it's nice and generic so it doesn't 
require a MY_controller or anything else.

DEFAULT LOGIN:
Username: admin@admin.com
Password: password    


IMPORTANT:   
It is highly recommended that you use encrypted database sessions for security!


OPTIMIZATION:
It is recommended that you add your identity column as a unique index.
