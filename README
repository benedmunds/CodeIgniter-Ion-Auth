======================================
Ion Auth 2

The future of authentication (that's an awesome line isn't it)

by Ben Edmunds
added awesomeness by Phil Sturgeon
======================================

Redux Auth 2 had a lot of potential.  It's lightweight, simple, and clean, 
but had a ton of bugs and was missing some key features.  So we refactored 
the code and added new methods.

Now we have the new best version.  This version drops any backwards 
compatibility and makes things even more awesome then you could expect.

DOCUMENTATION:
Documentation WILL BE located at http://benedmunds.com/ion_auth2/

INSTALLATION:
Just copy the files from this package to the correspoding folder in your 
application folder.  For example, copy Ion_auth/config/ion_auth.php to 
system/application/config/ion_auth.php. 

USING THE LIBRARY:   
In the package you will find example usage code in the controllers and views 
folders.  The example code isn't the most beautiful code you'll ever see but 
it'll show you how to use the library and it's nice and generic so it doesn't 
require a MY_controller or anything but it will be easy to add render() methods 
if needed since there is only one load->view() per controller method.

DEFAULT LOGIN:
Username: admin@admin.com
Password: password    


IMPORTANT:   
It is highly recommended that you use encrypted database sessions for security!


OPTIMIZATION:
It is recommended that you add your identity column as an index.
