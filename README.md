##Ion Auth for Contact Engine
This is a feature branch for Ion Auth (https://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Ion-Auth) which focuses on supporting Contact Engine (https://github.com/damko/Contact-Engine) authentication methods

Branch 2 is currently working even if there are still some things to improve.

It's supposed to be used as a Code Igniter Spark, so to use it do:

1) create the directories sparks/ion_auth/2.3.3
2) download the code in that directory
3) use it as you'd use any other Spark
