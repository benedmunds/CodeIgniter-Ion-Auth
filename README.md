# Ion Auth 4
### The future of authentication
by [Ben Edmunds](http://benedmunds.com)

Simple and lightweight authentication for your CodeIgniter apps.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Ion Auth 2 dropped any backwards compatibility and made things more
awesome.

Ion Auth 3, while not dropping as much backwards compatibility, made things
even more awesome!
=======
Note, this version is meant to be used with CodeIgniter 4 and is not backwards compatible with previous versions.  The database is backwards compatible though for those migrating from previous versions.

## Server requirements
Ion Auth 4 needs **CodeIgniter 4** and **PHP 7.1**.

## Documentation
Documentation is located at http://benedmunds.com/ion_auth/

## Upgrading
See [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) file.

## Installation
See [INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md) file.

## Usage
In the package you will find example usage code in the controllers and views
folders.  The example code isn't the most beautiful code you'll ever see but
it'll show you how to use the library and it's nice and generic so it doesn't
require a MY_controller or anything else.

### Default Login
Username: admin@admin.com
Password: password


### Important
It is highly recommended that you use encrypted database sessions for security!
